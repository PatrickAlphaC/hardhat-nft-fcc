    // When we send a transaction, it is "compiled" down to bytecode and sent in a "data" object of the transaction.
    // That data object now governs how future transactions will interact with it.
    // For example: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x112133a0a74af775234c077c397c8b75850ceb61840b33b23ae06b753da40490

    // Now, in order to read and understand these bytes, you need a special reader.
    // This is supposed to be a new contract? How can you tell?
    // Let's compile this contract in hardhat or remix, and you'll see the the "bytecode" output - that's that will be sent when
    // creating a contract.

    // This bytecode represents exactly the low level computer instructions to make our contract happen.
    // These low level instructions are spread out into soemthing call opcodes.

    // An opcode is going to be 2 characters that represents some special instruction, and also optionally has an input

    // You can see a list of there here:
    // https://www.evm.codes/
    // Or here:
    // https://github.com/crytic/evm-opcodes

    // This opcode reader is sometimes abstractly called the EVM - or the ethereum virtual machine.
    // The EVM basically represents all the instructions a computer needs to be able to read.
    // Any language that can compile down to bytecode with these opcodes is considered EVM compatible
    // Which is why so many blockchains are able to do this - you just get them to be able to understand the EVM and presto! Solidity smart contracts work on those blockchains.

    // Now, just the binary can be hard to read, so why not press the `assembly` button? You'll get the binary translated into
    // the opcodes and inputs for us!
    // We aren't going to go much deeper into opcodes, but they are important to know to understand how to build more complex apps.

    // How does this relate back to what we are talking about?
    // Well let's look at this encoding stuff

    // In this function, we encode the number one to what it'll look like in binary
    // Or put another way, we ABI encode it.
    function encodeNumber() public pure returns (bytes memory) {

    // encodePacked
    // This is great if you want to save space, not good for calling functions.
    // You can sort of think of it as a compressor for the massive bytes object above.
    function encodeStringPacked() public pure returns (bytes memory) {
        bytes memory someString = abi.encodePacked("some string");
        return someString;
    }

    // This is just type casting to string
    // It's slightly different from below, and they have different gas costs
    function encodeStringBytes() public pure returns (bytes memory) {
        bytes memory someString = bytes("some string");
        return someString;
    }

    function decodeString() public pure returns (string memory) {

        (string memory someString, string memory someOtherString) = abi.decode(
            multiEncode(),
            (string, string)
        );

        return someString;
    }

    // As of 0.8.13, you can now do `string.concat(string1, string2)`

    // This abi.encoding stuff seems a little hard just to do string concatenation... is this for anything else?
    // Why yes, yes it is.
    // Since we know that our solidity is just going to get compiled down to this binary stuff to send a transaction...

    // We could just use this superpower to send transactions to do EXACTLY what we want them to do...

    // Remeber how before I said you always need two things to call a contract:
    // 1. ABI
    // 2. Contract Address?
    // Well... That was true, but you don't need that massive ABI file. All we need to know is how to create the binary to call
    // the functions that we want to call.

    // Solidity has some more "low-level" keywords, namely "staticcall" and "call". We've used call in the past, but
    // haven't really explained what was going on. There is also "send"... but basically forget about send.

    // call: How we call functions to change the state of the blockchain.
    // staticcall: This is how (at a low level) we do our "view" or "pure" function calls, and potentially don't change the blockchain state.

    // When you call a function, you are secretly calling "call" behind the scenes, with everything compiled down to the binary stuff
    // for you. Flashback to when we withdrew ETH from our raffle:

    function withdraw(address recentWinner) public {
        (bool success, ) = recentWinner.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
        require(success, "Transfer Failed");
    }

    // Remember this?
    // - In our {} we were able to pass specific fields of a transaction, like value.
    // - In our () we were able to pass data in order to call a specific function - but there was no function we wanted to call!
    // We only sent ETH, so we didn't need to call a function!
    // If we want to call a function, or send any data, we'd do it in these parathesis!

    // Let's look at another contract to explain this more...
}
